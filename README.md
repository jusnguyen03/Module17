# Module17

## Project Overview
I will be using Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. I will be:
  - Explaining how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
  - Creating training and test groups from a given data set.
  - Implementing the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
  - Interpreting the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
  - Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
  - Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario.
  - Using ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will build and evaluate several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from LendingClub; a peer-to-peer lending services company.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Implement machine learning models.
  2. Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
  3. Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.


## Challenge Submission
Please check in the Module17 repository for files "credit_risk_ensemble_challenge.ipynb" and "credit_risk_resampling_challenge.ipynb" for codes and analysis, which are located at the bottom of each notebook.

In conclusion, of all the models that were tested in this challenge,  I recommend using the Easy Ensemble Adaboost Classifier. It has a highest accuracy of 93% at identifying true positives and true negatives. The precision value is also higher, which means the modeling is more accurate at predicting true low-risk and high-risk. This will help us identify actual high-risk loans more accurately, which will save the company money. Loaning out money to people that are considered high-risk will expose the company to a potential of losing money. In the business of credit risk, this is extremely important, so I feel that the Easy Ensemble Adaboost Classifier model is the best.
